Project overview:
 Github auth for login and gives the project setup for flutter or react native in one click and off loads the heavy builds to the users own Github actions for builds and for the project storing uses users own google drive for saving the projects in the drive so taht user own there project files as will as there workflows in the Github for preview of the apps for react native it uses expo approch like expo go and for flutter it uses the treditional way of hooking the phone to the machine with debugging mode to get the preview of the app.
the platform also supports AI App builder feature like the replit but for the app building for flutter and react native 
and teh ai is also present in the ide too for teh code suggestions and teh code changes like a code agent.
Technical steps to take:
for the builds i will be automating a system that in my own personal account there will be two repos one for flutter and one for react native and each having the basic setup stuffs pre installed and put for the initial start up and first hello world code to run now these two repos will get copy to the users accout when teh project is triggred if teh react ntaive is triggred the react native repo will get copied over and same for teh flutter repo too when the build is triggred teh code is pushed to teh users repo and the build is building there once done it is pulled back with the output over depending on teh project react native qr code adn flutter out put on peronal device. for google drive we should be fully transpanrent on teh use and only stick to a folder for abusing drive and hummering it with every stroke i will be setting a indexDB where the code will be stiored up to one minute and in one call teh whole indexDB is emptied over to teh drive keeping teh ide smooth and responsive. for ai App builder and  and ide aI i will be attaching googles gemini CLI and uses users own auth and there quoate fo rthe ai so i am not charged and the gemini gives 1000 free calls on auth and i will be capping the isers to use only 100 calls from there qouta so they wont abuse it and i will make the AI to make chnages to the workflow similer to teh vs code sso that AI capabilities are used fully. and in my repos i forgot to mention i will only keep the latest and teh stable sdk avalible and if some one wants a diffrent sdk they can download and our platform durig the setup it will create a custom repo in there account and download the basic depnedancies according to it and set them up and i am caling it on demand project.
Costs and some special plan features:
on free tier i can call it hobbies now for the free tier 5 project is teh max they can set and 1 on demand project. one repo and normal slow builds. tracks the ram usage and only lets 5gb to 6gb out of 7 to be used in teh free tier. no extra resources and only 100 ai calls in there qouta.
on Pro(full stack devoloper) plan teh user can making up to 10 projects and 4 on demand projects and have double repo for faster builds teh build will be split between the repos so that build is processed and build faster for the pro users basically they are getting 14gb ram but in splits for AI they get 400 calls to teh gemini on tehre qouta and also they get teh special features like automatic upload to google playstore or downlaod teh sdk locally and test it out as an app locally.
on team(enterprise) plan unlimited projects and up to 50 on demand projects tehy get the same faster builds like pro plan and tehy can use all 1000 calls daily from tehre qouta of gemini ai calls for special features now upto 10 devolopers repos are in combined and shared workflows so they are all workin on teh same work space thyey get logs on who changed teh code which code they add and who is online for real time code shareing and stuff now t keep teh teams in contact they can connect there discord server to the ide and on real time they can interact and code at the same time they also get the same features to uplaod and downlaod sdk locallly and to playstore like pro plan.
Marketing Plan:
build a basic working ide with flutter and react native connected no auth or anything just flutter or react native runnning a demo for reddit and twitter and on each month upload new update to demo like auth ai and diffrent features each month untill the app is fully devoloped.

make sure that react  native stays away from flutter code base they need to operate seprately so they dont get confused on each other and i will make sure that each point talks with each other seemlessly and dont get broken as will as the repos for react native and flutter are both seprete so there builds or dependancies or sdks dont mix up
